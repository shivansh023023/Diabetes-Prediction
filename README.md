# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This project demonstrates the implementation of a diabetes prediction model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health indicators.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately predict the onset of diabetes. The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and perform initial data exploration to understand its structure and characteristics.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, scale the features, and split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train an SVM classifier on the preprocessed training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using accuracy score on both training and testing data.
Predictive System: Create a system to make predictions on new data instances.
# Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which is publicly available. It contains health metrics for female patients of Pima Indian heritage and includes features such as:

Pregnancies
Glucose
BloodPressure
SkinThickness
Insulin
BMI
DiabetesPedigreeFunction
Age
Outcome (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic)
